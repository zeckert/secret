# secret

You are given a function 'secret()' that accepts a single integer parameter and returns an integer. In your favorite programming language, write a command-line program that takes one command-line argument (a number) and determines if the secret() function is additive [secret(x+y) = secret(x) + secret(y)], for all combinations x and y, where x and y are all prime numbers less than the number passed via the command-line argument.  Describe how to run your examples. Please generate the list of primes without using built-in functionality.

## To Run
Clone the repo, navigate to '/FindSecret/Released/' and run FindSecret.exe. Requires Windows

1. Enter a positive integer greater than 0
2. Outputs list of primes less than N and says whether secret is additive for N
